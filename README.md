## Appendix
 
### Download R

 * https://www.r-project.org/

### Install RStudio

 * https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

Alternatives to local installs on your Laptop:
Hosted RStudio IDE through CognitiveClass.ai 
 * Available here: https://labs.cognitiveclass.ai/tools/rstudio-ide/ 
 
### Set up RStudio + Keras

 * https://keras.rstudio.com/

This is dependent on how you have Python set up.
 * Use system Python to start, custom Python and Conda setups will require some troubleshooting
 * install the keras package through RStudio
 * run "install_keras"
 
 ### Set up RStudio + Tensorflow
  
  * https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tensorflow/articles/installation.html
  * Install the tensorflow packages through RStudio
  * run "install_tensorflow" if you did not run "install_keras" in the previous step already
